[IntelliPort](https://www.moga.doctor/#intelliport-top) is a program that you can use to connect to other computers, using either your null modem cable or Ethernet connection. IntelliPort records the messages passed to and from the computer on the other end of your connection. Therefore, it can serve as a valuable troubleshooting tool when setting up and using your modem. To make sure that your modem is connected properly or to view your modemâ€™s settings, you can send commands through IntelliPort and check the results. IntelliPort has scroll functionality that allows you to look at received text that has scrolled off the screen. You can use IntelliPort to transfer large files from a computer onto your portable computer using a serial port rather than going through the process of setting up your portable computer on a network. IntelliPort is designed to be an easy-to-use tool and is not meant to replace other full-feature tools available on the market. You can use IntelliPort to perform the specific tasks described above, but do not attempt to use IntelliPort for more complex communication needs.
